let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)

print(sum) // Output: 15

//The above code is fine and the sum is calculated correctly.

//However, if we change the code to be like below:

let numbers2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
let sum2 = numbers2.reduce(0){ $0 + $1 }
print(sum2) // Output: 15

//The code above seems the same and also the sum is calculated correctly.

//But there is a subtle difference when using a custom closure to perform the addition operation within reduce, and its when working with optional values

//Example:

let optionalNumbers: [Int?] = [1, 2, nil, 4, 5]

let sum3 = optionalNumbers.reduce(0, +) //Output: 12, because nil values are simply ignored

let sum4 = optionalNumbers.reduce(0) { $0 + ($1 ?? 0) } // Output: 12, because nil values are treated as 0

//The difference becomes more pronounced if we were to use a different initial value in the reduce operation 

let sum5 = optionalNumbers.reduce(100, +) //Output: 112
let sum6 = optionalNumbers.reduce(100) { $0 + ($1 ?? 0)} // Output 112

//However, if the initial value is something other than 0 and the array is empty, the output varies

let emptyArray: [Int?] = []

let sum7 = emptyArray.reduce(100, +) // Output: 100
let sum8 = emptyArray.reduce(100) { $0 + ($1 ?? 0)} // Output: 100

//In essence, this bug arises because the concise operator (+) ignores nil values, whereas the custom closure explicitly handles them. This can lead to unexpected results when working with arrays containing optional values, and can be very difficult to debug and trace when working with larger and complex data structures. This behavior is not necessarily a bug but rather a subtle difference in the way the reduce function handles optional values depending on whether a concise operator or a custom closure is used.
